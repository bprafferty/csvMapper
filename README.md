Project: CSV Mapper

This project is developed using python and powered by the folium and pandas libraries. 

Install folium and pandas on your local machine and then execute the code by typing: python csvMapper.py

You will be prompted with a message asking for the csv file you desire to map. Make sure the csv contains a latitude and longitude column before proceeding. Enter the file path to find your csv file on your local machine.

Next, you will be asked what you desire the output file for your map to be named.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter the type of map you wish to design, enter 1 for a Marker Map or 2 for a Heat Map.
